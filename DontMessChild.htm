            1. A little girl was talking to her teacher about whales.&nbsp;
            The teacher said it was physically impossible for a whale to swallow a human
            because even though it was very large mammal its throat was very small.&nbsp;
            The little girl stated that Jonah was swallowed by a whale.&nbsp;
            Irritated, the teacher reiterated that a whale could not swallow a human; it was physically impossible.&nbsp;
            The little girl said, "When I get to heaven I will ask Jonah."&nbsp;
            The teacher asked, "What if Jonah went to hell?" The little girl replied, "Then you ask him."

            2. One day a little girl was watching her mother do the dishes 
            when she noticed that her mother had several strands of white hair sticking out in contrast on her brunette head.&nbsp;
            She asked, "Why are some of your hairs white, Mum?"&nbsp;
            Her mother replied, "Well, every time you do something naughty, one of my hairs turns white."&nbsp;
            The little girl thought about this and then asked, "Mummy, how come ALL of grandma's hairs are white?"
            </p>

            3. The children had all been photographed and the teacher was trying to persuade them each to buy a copy of the group picture.&nbsp;
            "Think how nice it will be when you're older and can say, 'There's Jennifer, she's a lawyer,' or 'That's Michael, he's a doctor."&nbsp;
            A small voice at the back of the room rang out, "And there's the teacher, she is dead."
            </p>

            4. A kindergarten teacher was observing her classroom of children while they were drawing.&nbsp; What's this?&nbsp;
            The girl replied, "I'm drawing God."&nbsp; The teacher paused and said, "But no one knows what God looks like."&nbsp;
            Without hesitating, or looking up from her drawing, the girl replied, "They will in a minute."

            5. The children were lined up in the cafeteria of a Catholic elementary school for lunch.&nbsp;
            At the head of the table was a large pile of apples.&nbsp;
            The nun made a note, and posted on the apple tray: "Take only ONE.&nbsp;  God is watching."&nbsp;
            Moving further along the lunch line, at the other end of the table was a large pile of chocolate chip cookies.&nbsp;
            A child had written a note, "Take all you want. &nbsp; God is watching the apples."
