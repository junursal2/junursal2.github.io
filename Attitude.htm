    <p>The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. 
    Attitude to me is more important than facts. 
    It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, 
    than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. 
    It is more important than appearance, giftedness, or skill...</p>
    <p>The remarkable thing is you have a choice every day regarding the attitude you will embrace for that day. 
    We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. 
    We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, 
    and that is our <span id="attitude"><b>attitude</b></span>. 
    I am convinced that life is ten percent what happens to me and ninety percent how I react to it. 
    And so it is with you. You are in charge of your attitude. &nbsp;-&nbsp;

    <p>Does your attitude toward your work or job match up with your attitude toward your Christian walk? 
    Or, is your positive attitude toward your Christian walk reflected in your work? If not, why not? Shouldnâ€™t they match?</p>
