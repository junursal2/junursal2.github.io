    <p>"He was born in an obscure village, the child of a peasant woman.
       He worked in a carpentry shop until he was thirty, and then for three years he was an itinerant preacher.</p>
    <br />
    <p>When the tide that popular opinion turned against him, his friends ran away.
       He was turned over to his enemies. He was tried and convicted. He was nailed upon a cross between two thieves.
       When he was dead, he was laid in a borrowed grave.</p>

    <p>He never wrote a book. He never held an office. He never owned a home. He never went to college.
        He never traveled more than two hundred miles from the place where he was born.
        He never did one of the things that usually accompanies greatness.</p>
        <br />
    <p>Yet all the armies that ever marched, and all the governments that ever sat, and all the King's that ever reigned,
        had not affected life upon this earth as powerfully as that One Solitary Life."
