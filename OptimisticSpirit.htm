        as the attractive young woman with the white cane made her way carefully up the steps.
        She paid the drive and, using her hands to feel the location of the seats,
        walked down the aisle and found the seat he'd told her was empty.
        Then settled in, placed here briefcase on her lap and rested her cane against her leg.</p>
		<img id="clinic" src="files/blind/clinic2.png" alt="eye clinic">
        <p>It had been a year since Susan, 34, became blind. 
        Due to a medical misdiagnosis she had been rendered sightless,
        and she was suddenly thrown into a world of darkness, anger, frustration and self-pity.</p>
        <p>Once a fiercely independent woman, Susan now felt condemned by this terrible twist
        of fate to become a powerless, helpless burden on everyone around her.
        A cloud of depression hung over Susan's once optimistic spirit.
        Just getting through each day was an exercise
        in frustration and exhaustion.  And all she had to cling to was her husband Mark.</p>
        <p>Mark was an Air Force officer and he loved Susan with all of his heart.
        When she first lost her sight, he watched her sink into despair 
        and was determined to help his wife gain the strength and
        confidence she needed to become independent again. 
        Mark's military background had trained him well to deal with sensitive situations,
        and yet he knew this was the most difficult battle he would ever face.</p>
        <p>Finally, Susan felt ready to return to her job, but how would she get there? 
        She used to take the bus, but was now too frightened to get around the city by herself.
        Mark volunteered to drive her to work each day, even though they worked at opposite ends of the city.
        At first, this comforted Susan and fulfilled Mark's need to protect his sightless wife
        who was so insecure about performing the slightest task.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-third">
        <p>Soon, however Mark realized that this arrangement wasn't working it was hectic, and costly.
        Susan is going to have to start taking the bus again, he admitted to himself.
        But just the thought of mentioning it to her made him cringe. She was still so fragile, so angry.
        How would she react?</p>
        <p>Just as Mark predicted, Susan was horrified at the idea of taking the bus again.
        He promised Susan that each morning and evening he would ride the bus with her,
        for as long as it took, until she got the hang of it.</p>
		<img id="blind" src="files/blind/blindwomancase.png" alt="blind woman with a cane and suitcase">
        <p>And that is exactly what happened. For two solid weeks, Mark, military uniform and all, 
        accompanied Susan to and from work each day. He taught her how to rely on her other senses,
        specifically her hearing, to determine where she was and how to adapt to her new environment.
        He helped her befriend the bus drivers who could watch out for her, and save her a seat.
        Each morning they made the journey together, and Mark would take a cab back to his office.</p>
        <p>Although this routine was even more costly and exhausting than the previous one, Mark
        knew it was only a matter of time before Susan would be able to ride the bus on her own.</p>
        <p>Finally, Susan decided that she was ready to try the trip on her own.
        Monday morning arrived, and before she left she threw her arms around Mark, her eyes
        filled with tears of gratitude for his loyalty, his patience, his love.
        She said goodbye, and for the first time, they went their separate ways.</p>
        <p>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday... Each day on her own went perfectly,
        and Susan had never felt better. She was doing it!  She was going to work all by herself!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-third">
        <p>On Friday morning, Susan took the bus to work as usual. 
        As she was paying for her fare to exit the bus, the driver said, "Boy, I sure envy you."</p>
        <p>Susan wasn't sure if the driver was speaking to her or not. After all, who on earth would ever envy a
        blind woman who had struggled just to find the courage to live for the past year?</p>
        <p>Curious, she asked the driver, "Why do you say that you envy me?" 
        The driver responded, "It must feel so good to be taken cared of and protected like you are."</p>
		<img id="military" src="files/blind/military.png" alt="military man">
        <p>Susan had no idea what the driver was talking about, and asked again, "What do you mean?"</p>
        <p>The driver answered, "You know, every morning for the past week, a fine looking
        gentleman in a military uniform has been standing across the corner watching you when you get off the bus.
        He makes sure you cross the street safely and he watches you until you enter your office
        building. Then he blows you a kiss, gives you a little salute and walks away. You are one lucky lady."</p>
        <p id="endpara">Tears of happiness poured down Susan's cheeks.
        For although she couldn't physically see him, she had always felt Mark's presence.
        She was lucky, so lucky, for he had given her a gift more powerful than sight, 
        a gift she didn't need to see to believe- the gift of love that can bring light where there had been
        darkness. <span>&#10066;</span></p>
