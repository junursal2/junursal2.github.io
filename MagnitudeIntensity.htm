<article class="w3-container">
    <p>A <b>seismic scale</b> is used to describe the strength or "size" of an earthquake. 
    There are two types of scales: <i>intensity</i> scales that describe the intensity or severity of ground shaking (quaking) 
    at a given location, and <i>magnitude</i> scales that measure the strength of the seismic event itself, 
    usually based on an instrumental record. The intensity and nature of ground shaking depends on the local geology;
    at a given locality the intensity of shaking depends on the magnitude and distance of the seismic event.</p>

    </figure>

    <p><i>Magnitude</i> and <i>Intensity</i> measure different characteristics of earthquakes.</p>

    <p><b>Magnitude</b> measures the energy released at the source of the earthquake.
       A quantitative measure of the actual size of the earthquake.
       It is determined from measurements on <a href="#ng" onclick="showPic('kinemetrics_seismograph')">seismographs</a>.
       It is denoted by M(number) e.g. M8 or M6.5.</p>
    <p><b>Intensity</b> measures the strength of shaking produced by the earthquake at a certain location.
       An indicator of the severity of shaking generated at a given location.
       It is determined from effects on people, human structure and the natural environment.
       Severity of shaking is much higher near the epicenter than farther away.
       It varies at each and every place. It is represented by Roman numerals (e.g. II, IV, IX).</p>
    <p>They are not positively correlated.  Greater magnitude does not necessarily means greater
       intensity.</p>
    <p>Unlike magnitude scales, intensity scales do not have a mathematical basis; 
       instead they are an arbitrary ranking based on observed effects. 
       Most seismic intensity scales have twelve degrees of intensity 
       and are roughly equivalent to one another in values but vary 
       in the degree of sophistication employed in their formulation.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>The <i>magnitude</i> is a number that characterizes the relative size of an earthquake. 
       Magnitude is based on measurement of the maximum motion recorded by a 
       <a href="#ng" onclick="showPic('kinemetrics_seismograph')">seismograph</a>. 
       Several scales have been defined, but the most commonly used are:</p>
    <pre>
    1. <b>local magnitude</b> (M<sub>L</sub>), commonly referred to as "Richter magnitude",
    2. <b>surface-wave magnitude</b> (M<sub>s</sub>),
    3. <b>body-wave magnitude</b> (M<sub>b</sub>),
    4. <b>moment magnitude</b> (M<sub>w</sub> or M).
    </pre>
    <p>Most seismological authorities, such as the United States Geological Survey (USGS), 
    report earthquake magnitudes as <i>moment magnitude</i>, which the press describes as "Richter magnitude".</p>
    <p>Below are the tables for the effects of earthquakes and the class names:</p>

    <p>The PHIVOLCS Earthquake Intensity Scale (<b>PEIS</b>) is a seismic scale used and developed 
        by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHILVOLCS) to measure the intensity of an earthquake.</p>
    <p>PHILVOLCS cites seismic scale specifically developed for the Philippine setting, the different geography of each country 
        and other "geological considerations" led to the development of PEIS.</p>
    <p>The <b>PEIS</b> was adopted in the Philippines in 1996 replacing the <i>Rossi-Forel</i> scale.</p>
    <p>The PEIS has ten intensity scales represented in Roman numerals with Intensity <b>I</b> being the weakest 
        and Intensity <b>X</b> being the strongest.</p>
